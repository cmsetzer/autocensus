-999999999,Data for this geographic area cannot be displayed because the number of sample cases is too small.
-888888888,The estimate is not applicable or not available.
-666666666,"Either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution."
-555555555,The estimate is controlled. A statistical test for sampling variability is not appropriate.
-333333333,The median falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution. A statistical test is not appropriate.
-222222222,Either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error. A statistical test is not appropriate.
-,"The estimate could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations. For a ratio of medians estimate, one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an open-ended distribution. The estimate could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations. For a ratio of medians estimate, one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an open-ended distribution. For a 5-year median estimate, the margin of error associated with a median was larger than the median itself."
N,The estimate or margin of error cannot be displayed because there were an insufficient number of sample cases in the selected geographic area.
(X),The estimate or margin of error is not applicable or not available.
median-,"The median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution (for example ""2,500-"")"
median+,"The median falls in the highest interval of an open-ended distribution (for example ""250,000+"")."
c,"An * indicates that the estimate is significantly different (at a 90% confidence level) than the estimate from the most current year. A ""c"" indicates the estimates for that year and the current year are both controlled; a statistical test is not appropriate."
*,"An * indicates that the estimate is significantly different (at a 90% confidence level) than the estimate from the most current year. A ""c"" indicates the estimates for that year and the current year are both controlled; a statistical test is not appropriate."
**,The margin of error could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations.
***,The margin of error could not be computed because the median falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an open-ended distribution.
*****,"A margin of error is not appropriate because the corresponding estimate is controlled to an independent population or housing estimate. Effectively, the corresponding estimate has no sampling error and the margin of error may be treated as zero."
